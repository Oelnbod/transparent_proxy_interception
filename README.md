# transparent_proxy_interception
-------------------------------

## Purpose

This is a proxy to perform passive monitoring of a device's network connection. 
I created it as I was fed up with other software (like wireshark) being inadequate for monitoring the target of the request, which is important for some of my tasks in testing devices, without installing monitoring software on them directly.

## Operation
